## 🧠 About Me
I am an **Assistant Professor of Economics** at the **Strome College of Business, Old Dominion University**.  
My work bridges **public, urban, and health economics**, focusing on how housing programs and safety nets affect individual and neighborhood outcomes.


My research explores:
  - 🏠 The impacts of **homeless shelters and housing programs** on property values and neighborhood well-being  
- 💊 The **economic evaluation of safety net programs** such as Peer Support Services from Medicaid and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)  
- 🌊 The implications of **coastal flooding** on real estate markets and community resilience  

I aim to produce **policy-relevant, data-driven insights** that improve the effectiveness of public programs and resource allocation.
